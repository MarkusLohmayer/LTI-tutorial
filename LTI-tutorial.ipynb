Hence, outputs are signals that depend on the system's internal state. In some cases outputs are not just functions of the internal state but also depend directly (without delay) on the input signals (direct feed-through).\n",

Then the outside temperature is a system input because it does not depend on the state of the building but has an influence on it. System outputs can for example be the room temperatures, the current heating power and the total ammount of consumed fuel."
