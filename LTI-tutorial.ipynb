    "\n",
    "Any kind of quantity that one could theoretically measure in a real-world system can be an output of the corresponding system model. Hence, outputs are signals that depend on the system's internal state. In some cases outputs are not just functions of the internal state but also depend directly (without delay) on the input signals (direct feed-through).\n",
    "Output signals are used to feed inputs of other systems (i.e. to model interaction between systems) or they are merely quantities that one ultimately wants to model/simulate/predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any kind of quantity that does not depend on the system's internal state can be an input to the system. \n",
    "Hence, inputs are signals that are fully determined by other systems external to the system under study. They may also be considered properties of the system's environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example a building and it's heating system can be modeled as a dynamical system. Then the outside temperature is a system input because it does not depend on the state of the building but has an influence on it. System outputs can for example be the room temperatures, the current heating power and the total ammount of consumed fuel."
