Hence, outputs are signals that depend on the system's internal state. In some cases outputs are not just functions of the internal state but also depend directly (without delay) on the input signals (direct feed-through).\n",

Then the outside temperature is a system input because it does not depend on the state of the building but has an influence on it.
